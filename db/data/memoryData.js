    description: 'Was a beautiful sunny day in Washington DC. I gathered with my pals, armed of a couple of beers and sticks then we headed to a big white and round building. Turns out we were a pretty big group. We were pretty bored and needed some action so we kind climbed fences and smashed some doors. Found some pretty cool things in there, so we posed for insta shots next to some neet artwork and shouted a people. Was nice but someone got shot and one of our pals dies from drug overdose. I think the lesson learnt is that we shouldn\'t do it again, no sir. But it\'s pretty cool, we still get buy guns at walmart. That\'ll keep me stimulated for now.',
