    description: 'Was a beautiful sunny day in Washington DC. I gathered with my pals, armed of a couple of beers and sticks then we headed to a big white and round building. Turns out we were a pretty big group. We were pretty bored and needed some action so we kind climbed fences and smashed some doors. Found some pretty cool things in there, so we posed for insta shots next to some neet artwork and shouted a people. Was nice but someone got shot and one of our pals dies from drug overdose. I think the lesson learnt is that we shouldn\'t do it again, no sir. But it\'s pretty cool, we still get buy guns at walmart. That\'ll keep me stimulated for now.',

    description: 'I had the most amazing meal on my birthday. It was a complete surprise, my husband actually pretended he had forgotten, and to make up for it took me to a last-minute shopping trip to central London. Then when it was time to go home, he said why not have a quick coffee before, leading me into a small cafe. But we did not stop there - he led me down stairs io the back, to what turned out to be a huge restaurant underground! I had no idea it was there! Absolutley lovely place, reminds me a bit of Grand Central Station in New York. the waiters handed me a glass of champagne and sang Happy Birthday. My husband said You belived I had forgotten, I never would! and wow he really had me fooled. A lovely birthday, with shopping and an amazing surpruse birthday meal- even better as it was so unexpected! Do you to this restaurant as it is truly amazing.',

    description: 'This memory is really special to me, as my daughter had been travelling all summer before starting university, so I had not seen her much. To be honest I was a bit upset thinking she had already mentally moved on, when I would be missing her so much. But her last evening before leaving for uni, she asked if I wanted to go on a walk at our favourite beach. I was surprised she did not want to see her local friends, but she said she preferred to spend the evneing with me. We arrived just as the sun started to go down, and had the most amazing tlak whilst walking - remembering all the summers in her childhood spent here. We have not talked so openly in years, about our relationship, the future, her worries and wishes. THis beach is special to me regardless because of the many happy summers spent here, but now I have an additonal ememory I will cherish forever.',

    description: 'I am really fond of this memory, as it just shows that things can always turn around even if they seem to go horribly wwrong! My girlfirend and I had been together for a couple of months, and I wanted to take her on an amazing date that included a walk though London following Jack the Rippers murders (she is a huge crime fan) and a tour of St Pauls. TUrns out I had gotten the time wrong, and we missed the tour- then it also started raining heavily. I thought it would be best to just skip ahead to St Pauls. When we got there (pretty drenched) turns out it was closed! I was horrified, and quite upset at my phenomenal lack of planning skills. But instead of getting mad she just laughed- she looked beautiful, with raindrops caught in her curly hair and eyelashes, glittering in the streetlight. She kissed me, and said I love you for the first time. I had never been that cold, wet and happy at the same time.',
